      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My name is Simon Latour, I am a 20-year-old software engineering student at the University of Guelph with a strong passion for programming and problem-solving. I grew up in Sarnia, Ontario, and graduated from St. Patrickâ€™s High School on the honour roll, where I developed a solid academic foundation.

Beyond my studies, I have a deep appreciation for animals, My family has a Shepherd and I take care of a small bioactive aquarium. Music is another significant interest; I collect vinyl records and have been learning to play bass guitar.

I also value time spent outdoors with my family at our cottage in northern Ontario. Activities such as fishing, boating, canoeing, and exploring trails on ATVs allow me to connect with nature.

I am currently seeking my first co-op employment opportunity in software engineering. I am eager to apply my technical skills, gain practical industry experience, and contribute to projects that challenge me to grow professionally while making a meaningful impact.</p>
